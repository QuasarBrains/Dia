# Dia

> [!note]
> This is one of many projects that I've started and is not yet finished. Although it is a bit of a backburner project, I do plan to fix bugs as they're reported, and add features over time. However, it is pre-1.0 in its current state.

Dia is a command line application for utilizing dialogical reasoning in order to problem-solve, make decisions, brainstorm, or many other things. Long-term, Dia will be capable of generating consumable content based on prompts, similar to Google's [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). For now, the focus will be on generating transcripts of dialogues in various formats.

The inspiration is the idea that dialogical reasoning can be a lot more powerful than monological. Simply interacting with a chatbot in the first place is great and all, however, being able to interact with multiple at once, or see debates play out, allows more significant brainstorming.

## Formats
Over time, more formats will be added, and none are yet complete. However, here are some formats I plan to add.
- **Debate**: Given a divisive topic, multiple participants will represent various positions, and argue over which is best. In the end, a tribunal will decide on the winner.
- **Expert discussion**: Given a topic, multiple participants will represent various perspectives on the topic, with the focus being on collaboration.

These are the two that I think would be most immediately beneficial.
